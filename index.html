                    <p>In the United States, Catholicism started out as the religion of immigrants. As floods of
                      newcomers arrived on these shores in the 19th century, they initially faced resistance from
                      native-born Americans. The Catholic population continued to grow and became one of the
                      largest religious groups in the nation. However, recent studies have shown that the church is
                      in danger of losing many of its followers. Now, the survival of the largest Christian
                      denomination in the country depends upon immigrants once more.

                          <p class="chapterTitleParagraph">During the infancy of the United States, almost
                                everyone practiced one of the various denominations of Protestantism. A small
                                Roman Catholic population existed, mainly in the Maryland area, and in 1789,
                                the Diocese of Baltimore became the first Catholic diocese in the nation.In the
                                mid 19th century, the wave of Irish and German Catholic immigrants quickly began
                                changing the religious makeup of the country. What was once a mostly Protestant
                                nation was now home to millions of Catholics, mostly in the urban centers of the
                                northeast. The arrival of Southern and Eastern European Catholics, like Italians
                                and Poles, continued to boost the population and by the turn of the century,
                                nearly 1/6 of the population was Catholic
                            </p>

                        <p class="chapterTitleParagraph">As American society moves closer towards a more secular lifestyle, many religions,
                                 including Catholicsm, have seen a decrease in their ranks. Although the Catholic community  in the United
                                 States is growing from a numbers standpoint, the overall percentage of americans who practice the religion
                                  has dropped significantly.According to the <a href="http://cara.georgetown.edu/frequently-requested-church-statistics/">Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate</a> (CARA), the number of parish-connected
                                  Catholics has grown from 47.9 million in 1970 to 68.5 million in 2017. However, that increase doesn’t take
                                  into account the general population growth of the country in the last half century. As a result of that boom,
                                  the Catholic community, which once comprised 33.3 percent of the US population in 1965, has decreased to 25.1 percent of the population in 2010, a net loss of 8.2 percent, according to <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/catholics-world/">The Washington Post</a>.

                                    From 2007 to 2014, the percentage of non-white Catholics in the US has increased from 35 percent to 41
                                    percent of the total Catholic population, according to the Pew Research Center study. That makes
                                    Catholicism the third most diverse Christian group (percentage-wise) in the country, after historically black Protestants and
